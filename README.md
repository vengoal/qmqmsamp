<p>To do this for ILE RPG/400, you can use the typical IBM i commands, CRTRPGMOD and CRTPGM.

After creating your *MODULE, you need to specify BNDSRVPGM(QMQM/LIBMQM) in the CRTPGM command. This includes the various IBM MQ procedures in your program.

Make sure that the library containing the copy files (QMQM) is in the library list when you perform the compilation.</p>
